I like the way your sparkling earrings lay
Against your skin so brown
And I want to sleep with you in the desert night
With a billion stars all around
Cause I got a peaceful easy feelin
And I know you wont let me down
Cause Im already standin
On the ground
And I found out a long time ago
What a woman can do to your soul
Aw but she cant take you any way
You dont already know how to go
And I got a peaceful easy feelin
And I know you wont let me down
Cause Im already standin
On the ground
I get this feelin I may know you
As a lover and a friend
This voice keeps whisperin in my other ear
Tells me I may never see you again
Cause I get a peaceful easy feelin
And I know you wont let me down
Cause Im already standin
Im already standin
Yes Im already standin
On the ground
