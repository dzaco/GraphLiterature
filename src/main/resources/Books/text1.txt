Theres talk on the street it sounds so familiar
Great expectations everybodys watching you
People you meet they all seem to know you
Even your old friends treat you like youre something new
Johnny come lately
The new kid in town
Everybody loves you
So dont let them down
You look in her eyes the music begins to play
Hopeless romantics here we go again
But after awhile youre lookin the other way
Its those restless hearts that never mend
Oh
Johnny come lately
The new kid in town
Will she still love you?
When youre not around
Theres so many things you should have told her
But night after night youre willing to hold her just hold her
Tears on your shoulder
Theres talk on the street its there to remind you
Doesnt really matter which side youre on
Youre walking away and theyre talking behind you
They will never forget you til somebody new comes along
Where you been lately?
Theres a new kid in town
Everybody loves him dont they?
A-a-h And hes holding her
And youre still around
Oh my-my
Theres a new kid in town
Just another new kid in town
